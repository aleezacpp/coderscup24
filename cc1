/*Problem A. Intense Contest

Problem Statement
During ACM's Developer's Day Competitive Programming contest, Warun participated and
worked tirelessly on several problems. The contest was so intense that he lost track of all his
submissions, and by the end, he was completely exhausted and unable to count them
himself.
Now, as his friend, it is your job to help him count his submissions.
There are N test cases in total. For each test case i (1 <= i <= N), you are given a string S[i]
that represents the verdict for that test case.
Your task is to determine the number of test cases that have each of the following verdicts:
AC , WA , TLE , and RE .
Refer to the Output section for the expected output format.*/
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main(){
    int n; //size of input
    int c=0;
    int w=0;
    int t=0;
    int r=0;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    char str[n][4];
    for (int i=0;i<n;i++){
        
            scanf("%s",str[i]);
    }
    for (int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if (strcmp(str[i],"AC")==0){
                c++;
            }
            else if (strcmp(str[i],"WA")==0){
                w++;
            }
            else if (strcmp(str[i],"TLE")==0){
                t++;
            }
            else if (strcmp(str[i],"RE")==0){
                r++;
            }
        }
    
    printf("AC x %d \n WA x %d \n TLE x %d \n RE x %d \n",c,w,t,r);
