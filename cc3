Problem Statement
You have been recruited by the mysterious Linguistics Society, where members are
obsessed with deciphering unique patterns in texts. One of the patterns they study is called
a hard-to-read string. According to the society's rules, a string is deemed hard-to-read
when:
Characters in odd positions (such as the 1st, 3rd, 5th, ... from the beginning) are all
lowercase English letters.
Characters in even positions (such as the 2nd, 4th, 6th, ... from the beginning) are all
uppercase English letters.
Your task is to determine whether a given string S adheres to the society's definition of a
hard-to-read string.

Constraints
consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
The length of is between and (inclusive).*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    //user inputs a string, at odd indexes we need lowercase letters, at even indexes we need uppercase
    //is this char by char reading?
    //is tis a 2d array or naah
    //arr[i] will be one row so 1 word itself
    //but we need to check if chars are cap or not
    int n; //array length
    scanf("%d",&n);
    char S[1000]; //string wont run to thousand?? obv lol
    scanf("%s",S);
    //i+2 if i starts from 0?
    //j+1 and array starts from 0?
